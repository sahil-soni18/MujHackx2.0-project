# AI-Powered Early Warning System üåçüö®

**Project Name:** MUJHACKX 2.0 - AI-Powered Early Warning System

**Project URL:** [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/thedarkking01/MujHackx2.0-project)

## Overview üìú

This project was created during the **MUJHACKX 2.0 Hackathon** as an **AI-powered real-time disaster monitoring system**. It leverages various APIs and services to track disaster events like earthquakes, floods, and severe weather conditions in real-time, alerting users to potential dangers via automated SMS notifications.

The goal is to provide a fast, reliable, and scalable solution for early warnings to save lives and reduce disaster-related damages.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Real-time disaster monitoring** using USGS (United States Geological Survey) and OpenWeather APIs.
- **Automated alerts** via SMS using Twilio to notify users of potential hazards in their area.
- **Scalable and efficient** disaster detection with accurate prediction models for early warnings.
- **Modular and extensible design** allows for adding new types of disaster detection (e.g., wildfires, landslides).
- **User-friendly** interface and alert system.
